# Installation 

- Download VIA Mod Manager
- MO2 left side order doesn't matter.
- Load `Toggleable Combat Music.esp` anywhere, the mod uses a Script to change values, and I don't know of another mod that isn't also a Combat Music mod, that does that.
- In the Inns and Taverns MCM, change the default room cost to 10

# Compatibility

- I'm unaware of any mod this conflicts with other than other "No Combat Music" type mods.

# Known Issues

- None.

# Limitations

- Turning combat music off while in combat, won't stop the already playing music afaict (unsure if it would then also prevent the music from stopping altogether - need to test more).
